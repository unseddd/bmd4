# bMD4: the (bad)Message Digest 4 Transform

This is a largely untested, hopefully correct version of the MD4 algorithm defined by [RFC-1320](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1320).

# WARNING: CONTAINS CRYPTOGRAPHIC CODE UNTESTED BY THE CRYPTOGRAPHIC COMMUNITY

Cryptographic libraries should always go through rigorous review and testing by relevant experts before seeing practical use.

This library has received *neither* of those.

I have done my best to implement and test the algorithm to ensure correctness, but this library is purely to learn about how MD4 actually works.

*Please* do not use this library for anything besides toy/educational purposes.
